# SFTP Applications for Mac

## CyberDuck (My Recommendation)

[Cyberduck Download (Free version)](https://cyberduck.io/download/)

Mac specific remote file browsing application.

Simpler UI than FileZilla and, in my experience, more intuitive to
use alongside with the Mac's Finder.

Only downside is everytime you quit the app it asks you to donate.
If this drives you insane, then consider using FileZilla (or just donate I guess).

## FileZilla

[FileZilla Download](https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?type=client#close)

Cross-platform app available for Windows, Mac, and Linux.

Has a more sophisticated UI and more features than Cyberduck.
