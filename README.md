This repo contains Mac-specific resources for making the best use
of the CS department's lab machines.

I have included instructions for how to SSH into a lab machine and suggested applications for transferring files between machines.

I have also included some more advanced resources, like a Python script which will make SSHing even easier, instructions for changing shells, and an SSH VSCode extension.
